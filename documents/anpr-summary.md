# Summary of ANPR

		Nowadays, traffic issues have reached new heights. It becomes difficult to trace a car, traffic fines, and identify a vehicle owner who violates traffic rules and drives too fast. The traffic people might not be able to retrieve the vehicle number from the moving vehicle. As a result, one of the solutions to this problem is to develop an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is an image processing technology. It uses the number plate to identify the vehicle. It aims to create an efficient, automated, authorised vehicle identification system by using vehicle number plates. The system uses a range of image processing techniques to identify the vehicle from a database stored on the PC. The developed system first detects the vehicle and then captures the image of the vehicle. The captured image is processed and the contours are used to recognise the licence plate. The characters in the licence plate are then segmented under specific sizing conditions. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, a machine learning algorithm, is used to recognise the segmented characters. Optical Character Recognition technology is used for character recognition. The resulting data is then used to compare with the records on the database to come up with specific information like the vehicle owner, place of registration, address, etc. Its performance is tested in real-time. The implementation works quite well, but there is still room for improvement.

		In this report, various methods of ANPR are discussed, considering success rate, processing time, and image size as parameters. At the end of this paper, the extension of ANPR is suggested.
